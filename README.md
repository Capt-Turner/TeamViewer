# Team Viewer

Welcome to my Team Viewer app. This is a command-line application where you, the user, can input information about your engineering team and receive a HTML page that displays the relative data per employee through the use of Inquirer.

## How's it Work?

Here is a short [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gn1wu7__eN_P7VTV3hHG6kzTF_WYFPLH/view) to help you get started. If you need more help, refer back to this section for some guidelines.

> Step 1: Download this repo and place it in a folder of your choice
>
> Step 2: Open up your terminal and input `npm i` to install the required dependencies
>
> Step 3: Input `npm test` to run the built in tests which will show if the repo has any fatal errors in its process. If it fails any tests check that all files were downloaded properly. If it still fails, feel free to contact me (see bottom of README), I may have accidnetaly broke something
>
> Step 4: Once the tests pass, input `npm start` to launch the app proper
>
> Step 5: Follow the built in prompts and answer them accordingly to build your team
>
> Step 6: Once you're finished building, select `My team is finished` to generate your page. It can be found in the dist folder as *teamview.html*. You are free to use this as you please, however, if you leave it in the dist folder, it will get overwritten if you build again.
